The process involves two main steps:

Transposing the matrix.
Reversing each row of the transposed matrix.
Here is the solution implemented in Python:

Transposing the Matrix: Transposing means converting rows into columns and columns into rows. This can be achieved by swapping elements.

Reversing Each Row: After the transposition, reversing each row will give the final rotated matrix.
